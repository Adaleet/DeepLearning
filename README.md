Welcome! This repository contains notes, code, and assignments related to the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by Coursera, designed by Andrew Ng.

## Course Overview

The Deep Learning Specialization consists of five courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: Introduction to deep learning concepts, basic neural networks, and key optimization techniques.
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**: Learn strategies for improving your models such as hyperparameter tuning, dropout, and batch normalization.
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**: Best practices for setting up and organizing machine learning projects.
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Explore convolutional networks for image recognition and other applications.
5. **Sequence Models**: Dive into sequence models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for handling sequential data.
